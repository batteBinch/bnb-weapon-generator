      This weapon features two kinds of fire modes: automatic and burst-fire. In automatic mode, you attack as normal,
      but in burst-fire mode, you make multiple attacks, with each attack that hits dealing a fixed amount of damage.
      Each attack in burst-fire mode consumes ammunition.
    - >
      The notation for burst-fire damage is NxD where N is the number of shots and D is the damage of each shot that
      hits. You can switch between modes using a free action.
