      When reloading, this weapon can be thrown up to 30 feet, where it explodes upon impact. Enemies within 10 feet of

      On a fail, a creature takes damage equal to 2 times the number of bullets left in the clip, or 5 damage if there
      ammunition left. On a success, only half damage is taken.

    - >
      When reloaded, this weapon can be thrown up to 30 feet. Upon landing, it acts as a mobile turret with a movement
      speed of 20 feet.
    - >
      This turret acts on your initiative order and can only move and use the attack action. When this turret attacks,
      uses the remaining ammunition in the clip when it was thrown. A thrown weapon will not turn into a mobile turret
      if one is already out.
    - >
      Once the clip is empty, the turret deconstructs itself. Additionally, if the turret is thrown with no ammunition
      its clip, it instead explodes like a grenade on impact, dealing 5 damage in a 5-foot radius.

      When reloading, this weapon can be thrown up to 30 feet where it mounts to the surface it lands on and acts as a
      sentry gun. This gun can mount to any surface and can be upside-down as well.

      Any time a creature ends their turn within the first range increment of this sentry, the sentry can make an
      attack against it, if desired. It attacks using the ammunition left in the magazine before it was thrown.

      A thrown weapon will not mount into a sentry if a sentry is already out. When a sentry has 0 ammunition in its
      magazine, it deconstructs. Furthermore, if this weapon is thrown with no ammunition in its clip, it explodes like
      a grenade, dealing 5 damage in a 5-foot radius.
