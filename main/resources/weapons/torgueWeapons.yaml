      This weapon fires gyro-jets instead of normal bullets. Gyro-jets are rockets fired from normal magazines which
      explode on impact.
    - >
      Additionally, you can use a free action to switch to sticky bomb mode. In this mode, gyro-jets do not explode on
      impact. Instead, they stick to any surface that they land on. As a reaction, all sticky bombs currently in play
      can be detonated at once. However, a maximum of 4 sticky bombs can be out at a time.
    - >
      When firing sticky bombs at a target, make an attack roll. On a hit, the sticky bomb sticks to the target.
      Otherwise, the DM will choose a random point where the sticky bomb lands depending on the attack roll.
    - >
      When either a gyro-jet or a sticky bomb explodes, all creatures within 5 feet of the explosion must make a
      Dexterity saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency
      bonus if you are proficient with Pistols. On a fail, a creature takes full damage; otherwise, it only takes half
      damage.
